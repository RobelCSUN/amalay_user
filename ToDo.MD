2. Enable Push Notifications in Xcode

open ios/Runner.xcworkspace


	2.	In the Runner target:

3. Create an APNs Key in Apple Developer Console
	1.	Sign in: https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/list
	2.	Click + to create a new key.
	3.	Name it (e.g., FirebaseAPNsKey), check Apple Push Notifications service (APNs).
	4.	Download the .p8 file and note:
	â€¢	Key ID
	â€¢	Team ID (from your Apple Developer account)

4. Add APNs Key to Firebase
	1.	Go to Firebase Console â†’ Project Settings â†’ Cloud Messaging tab.

5. Enable Phone Auth in Firebase
	1.	Firebase Console â†’ Authentication â†’ Sign-in method.
	2.	Enable Phone.
	3.	(Optional) Add test phone numbers for quick dev testing.

6. Rebuild and Test
	â€¢	In Flutter:

flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run


	â€¢	Use a real phone number â€” now the verification SMS should work.

ðŸ’¡ Why this is needed: On iOS, Firebase Phone Auth uses APNs behind the scenes to silently verify phone numbers. Without APNs configured, iOS will throw the internal-error youâ€™re seeing.

Do you want me to also make you a short version of this note just for quick reference? That way you wonâ€™t have to read the long one every time.
